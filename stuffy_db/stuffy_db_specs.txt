Stuffy DB
===========================
Think of the movie Toy Story, specifically 'The Claw!'.  The Claw
is in a stuffy dispenser and is used to select stuffed animals and 
release them to customers.

This project is focused on creating a database to store stuffies used
in the stuffy dispenser.  We need a simple database and a table 
to keep track of stuffies.

Specifics:
1)  Create a sql script...  stuffy_db_create.sql
2)  Create a database named stuffy_db
3)  Create a table named Stuffy, with the following attributes:
id:		int				primary key auto-increment
type:	varchar(255)
color:	varchar(20)
size:	varchar(2)
limbs:	int
4)	Other requirements/specifics:
- 'type' is the stuffy type.  Think alligator, cat, dog, octopus, etc.
- 'color' should be obvious.  :)  Red, Green, Blue, etc.
- 'size' will be xs, s, m, l, xl, etc.
- 'limbs' refers to # of limbs
5)	Add at least 10 stuffies
6)	Create a user acct and grant the appropriate privileges
7)	Run some queries:
- How many total stuffies?
- How many red stuffies?
- How many stuffies per color?
- How many total limbs?
- What stuffy has the most limbs?
- Come up with others... get creative!
